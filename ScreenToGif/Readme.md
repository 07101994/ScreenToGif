TO-DO:

• The Editor window.
• Board Recorder.
• Text recorder.
• You shouldnt play the preview while executing something.

• Pressed Keys overlay.
• Follow the cursor while recording without need to reajust the window position (free recording).
• Option to reduce number of colors.  http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/34792/Quick-how-to-Reduce-number-of-colors-programmatica
• Zoom effect.
• Morph algorithm.  http://www.codeforge.com/article/216937
• (Stalled) Image upload (ImgUr)  http://api.imgur.com/, Example 
• More startup args.
• Fast Rewind transition.
• TitleFrame delay should be a param.
• Any action shouldn't remove the image and alter everything.

• Tooltips with the shortcuts...
• "Select" tab with lots of selections options, (select first, etc)

• Select multiple from frame list with mouse drag
• delete range dialog where I can specify start and end frame of deletion
• move range dialog where I can specify start and end frames and then offset frame number
• clone range dialog: start/end/new position

• Board Recorder should use different LastFps Width/Height parameters (it is using the same from the recorder), same applies to the webcam recorder.

• Xaml vector for Missing file, encoder window
• Display a better warning for the Missing file status.

• DoubleToSizeConverter to the Recorder window too.

BUGS:

• Undo/Redo/Reset is a little bit buggy.
• Takes a while to render the inserted frames.
• Trying to record while moving using the Alt + Space option to -Y (above top screen) does not work.
• Video import is buggy.
• DoubleNumericUpDown not showing new binding value.

• If selecting multiples frame from the end to the start, it will scroll to the end one. (Fix frame selection)
• Don't apply border or free drawing or watermark or crop or resize if there is nothing to do.

• First 2-3 frames are played with the maximum speed, even with 1000ms (preview feature).

 Done:

 • Nothing yet.
