### Fixed:

♦ The warning that apears when there's not enough space left on disk will only de displayed when there's less than 2GB left.

### Known Bugs:

♠ When saving a gif using the overwrite option while the output file has a usage lock, no error appears.  
♠ The Cinemagraph feature is broken for high DPI PCs. 

### To Test:

• When removing a setting from the settings file, try removing from a unformatted file.  
• DoubleBox (decimals stuff).   
• Progress percentage.
