#ScreenToGif

This is the current project of ScreenToGif.

VS 2015 and .Net 4.6.1 required.


Version 2.3.1:

• Now there's a warning about the lack of .Net Framework 4.6.1 when using >4.0 <4.6.1
• The panels "Apply/Cancel" buttons now have keyboard shortcuts as well. 

Fixed:

♦ The Ctrl+Z (Undo) action after applying an overlay.
♦ The Snapshot mode and Fullscreen mode options were switched on the Options window.
♦ It was impossible to apply a Slide transition effect.
♦ It was impossible to import a gif.
♦ Iy was impossible to export a single frame (right click on the frame list).
♦ Improved the cursor recording for dark, inverted and I-Beam cursors. Yay. 

Known bugs:

♠ OutOfMemory exception when importing videos.
